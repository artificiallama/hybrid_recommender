# hybrid_recommender

This project was completed as a part of York University Certificate course in Machine Learning by a team of two (including myself).

We designed a recommender system for an online sales company. This system used both
content-based and collaborative filtering. The products were divided into N categories. We adopted an approach to predict first the category
for each user, and then the top three products to be recommended to the user based on user similarity.

Unfortunately I cannot upload the code/data. I will be writing a summary of the approach used.
